## 📊 Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a customer will churn (leave the service) using machine learning techniques.
The model is trained on historical customer data, processed through feature engineering, and evaluated using various classification algorithms including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and more.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Businesses lose revenue when customers leave. Predicting churn helps companies take proactive actions such as personalized offers, targeted retention strategies, and service improvement.

## This project demonstrates:

- Data cleaning & preprocessing

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Feature encoding & scaling

- Model building and evaluation

- Hyperparameter tuning

- Prediction on test data

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python

- Pandas, NumPy

- Matplotlib / Seaborn

- Scikit-learn

- Jupyter Notebook

## 📘 Features
✔ Data Preprocessing

- Handling missing values

- Converting categorical data to numeric (Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding)

- Feature scaling (StandardScaler / MinMaxScaler)

✔ EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

- Visualizing churn distribution

- Correlation heatmaps

- Feature importance plots

✔ ML Models Implemented

- Logistic Regression

- Random Forest Classifier

- Decision Tree

- K-Nearest Neighbors

- Support Vector Machines

✔ Model Evaluation

- Accuracy

- Confusion Matrix

- Precision, Recall, F1-Score

- ROC-AUC score

## 📈 Results

The Random Forest model achieved:

- High accuracy on the test set

- Good balance between precision and recall

- Strong performance in identifying customers likely to churn

## 📊 Future Improvements

- Deploy model with Flask / FastAPI

- Create a dashboard using Streamlit

- Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV

- Try ensemble models like XGBoost / CatBoost
